                    HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, 
                    making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. 
                    It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, 
                    most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), 
                    or through sharing injection drug equipment. 
                    If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
                    AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the bodyâ€™s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.

                    Africa shows an exceptionally wide range, from 100 to 18,250, with most cases being relatively small. 
                    The Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, and Europe have narrower ranges, with many cases near the lower end.

                    The bar chart highlights Africa's disproportionate number of death cases due to HIV/AIDS compared to other WHO regions. 
                    This disparity can be attributed to higher HIV prevalence, limited access to healthcare and antiretroviral treatment, 
                    social and economic factors, and stigma. In contrast, regions like Europe and the Americas have made more progress in 
                    HIV prevention and treatment. Addressing these disparities requires urgent global efforts to improve access to testing,

                    For region like Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and Europe the number of people received ART is even less 1% of people living with HIV.
                    In contrast, Western Pacific number of people received ART exceed people living with HIV. This does not mean that everyone that living with HIV received ART.
                    Since people that is received ART can be part of prevention which means is not HIV/AIDS patient.

                    The histogram's left-skewed distribution, centered around 90 to 100% of pregnant women receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), 
                    is indeed a promising indication of effective HIV prevention and treatment efforts, particularly in the context of preventing mother-to-child
                    transmission. This suggests that a significant proportion of HIV-positive pregnant women are accessing ART, resulting in improved health 
                    outcomes and a reduced risk of transmission to their children. Such progress in expanding ART coverage globally signifies a crucial milestone 
                    in the ongoing battle against HIV, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing comprehensive interventions to ensure the well-being of both 
                    mothers and infants.

                    Argentina, Ukraine, Thailand, and Malaysia have the highest rates of pregnant women receiving ART at 95% underscores these countries' 
                    robust efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Conversely, Sudan's notably low rate of 5% suggests the urgent need for 
                    enhanced interventions and resources to improve ART access among pregnant women in the country, emphasizing the importance of targeted 
                    strategies to address regional disparities in HIV care.

                In conclusion, the analysis of HIV data across various regions underscores the progress and challenges in the global fight against the HIV epidemic. 
                While Africa has made strides in reducing HIV-related deaths and increasing the number of people living with HIV, regional disparities persist, 
                with the Eastern Mediterranean experiencing a significant growth in cases. The Americas exhibit a concentration of cases, raising questions about 
                targeted interventions and healthcare access. In terms of adult cases, Europe stands out for its lower percentage, emphasizing the effectiveness of 
                prevention and treatment efforts. However, regional variations in ART coverage for pregnant women and pediatric populations highlight the need for 
                targeted strategies to bridge these gaps. Ultimately, these insights emphasize the ongoing global challenge of HIV and the necessity for tailored, 
                region-specific approaches to prevention, testing, and treatment to achieve the goal of ending the HIV epidemic.
