                    HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, 
                    making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. 
                    It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, 
                    most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), 
                    or through sharing injection drug equipment. 
                    If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
                    AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the bodyâ€™s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.

                    Africa shows an exceptionally wide range, from 100 to 18,250, with most cases being relatively small. 
                    The Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, and Europe have narrower ranges, with many cases near the lower end. 
                    South-East Asia has a broad range, with some countries experiencing very high numbers, while the Western Pacific also shows variability.

                    The bar chart highlights Africa's disproportionate number of death cases due to HIV/AIDS compared to other WHO regions. 
                    This disparity can be attributed to higher HIV prevalence, limited access to healthcare and antiretroviral treatment, 
                    social and economic factors, and stigma. In contrast, regions like Europe and the Americas have made more progress in 
                    HIV prevention and treatment. Addressing these disparities requires urgent global efforts to improve access to testing, 
                    treatment, and prevention strategies in Africa to save lives and reduce the gap in HIV/AIDS-related deaths.

                    Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that attacks the body's immune system. 
                    Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the most advanced stage of the disease.
                    HIV targets the body's white blood cells, weakening the immune system. 
                    This makes it easier to get sick with diseases like tuberculosis, infections and some cancers.
                    HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, 
                    semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. 
                    It can also spread from a mother to her baby.
                    HIV can be treated and prevented with antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
                    Untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, often after many years.
                    WHO now defines Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) as CD4 cell count less than 200cells/mm3
