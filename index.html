                    <b style="color: #d81c1ce4;">HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)  </b> is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, 
                    making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. 
                    It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with <b style="color:#d81c1ce4;">HIV</b>, 
                    most commonly during <b>unprotected sex</b> (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), 
                    or through <b>sharing injection drug equipment. </b>
                    If left untreated, <b style="color:#d81c1ce4;">HIV</b> can lead to the disease <b style="color:#d81c1ce4;">AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)</b>.
                    <b style="color:#d81c1ce4;">AIDS</b> is the late stage of <b style="color:#d81c1ce4;">HIV</b> infection that occurs when the bodyâ€™s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.
